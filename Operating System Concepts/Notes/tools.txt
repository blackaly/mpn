- strace -> traces system calls invoked by a process.

- gdb -> a source-level debugger

- perf -> a collection of Linux performance tools

- tcpdump -> collects network packets.

- BCC -> for show the interactions between the programs and the kernel.

What makes BCC especially powerful is that its tools can be used on
live production systems that are running critical applications without causing
harm to the system. This is particularly useful for system administrators who
must monitor system performance to identify possible bottlenecks or security
exploits. Figure 2.20 illustrates the wide range of tools currently provided by
BCC and eBPF and their ability to trace essentially any area of the Linux operating system. BCC is a rapidly changing technology with new features constantly
being added.
